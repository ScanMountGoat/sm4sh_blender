## Building
Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/sm4sh_blender --recursive`. sm4sh_blender uses [sm4sh_model_py](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/sm4sh_model_py) for simplifying the addon code and achieving better performance than pure Python addons. sm4sh_model_py must be compiled from source after [installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
